This is a Character Recognition System which I've learnt for Devanagari Script. The learning model was trained on 92 thousand images (32x32 pixels) of 46 characters, digits 0 to 9 and consonants “ka” to “gya”. The optimal result, 92% accuracy, was obtained using Extremely Randomized Decision Forest Classification algorithm.

Devanagari
Devanagari is an Indic script and forms a basis for over 100 languages spoken in India and Nepal including Hindi, Marathi, Sanskrit, and Maithili. It consists of 47 primary alphabets, 14 vowels, and 33 consonants, and 10 digits. In addition, the alphabets are modified when a vowel is added to a consonant. There is no capitalization of alphabets, unlike Latin languages.

Character Recognition
Character Recognition is the identification of printed characters from an image, a book, a handwritten note, cheques, or letters. It is similar to using a handheld scanner to read a barcode, or reading OMR exam sheets, but it can distinguish between different alphabets.

Technique Used
We have used convolutional neural networks. Using Tensorflow as the framework and Keras API for providing a high level of abstraction.


Some additional points
-You can go for additional conv layers.
-Add regularization to prevent overfitting.
-You can add additional images to the training set for increasing the accuracy.


Python Implementation
Dataset- DHCD (Devnagari Character Dataset)
Images of size 32 X 32
Convolutional Network Support added.
